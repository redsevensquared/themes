**Note:** Replace ```Jeremy Vaught``` ```jeremyvaught``` ```https://jeremyvaught.com``` ```jeremy@jeremyvaught.com``` ```redsevensquared``` ```themes``` ```Core package to maintain themes``` with their correct values in [README.md](README.md), [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) and [composer.json](composer.json) files, then delete this line. You can run `$ php prefill.php` in the command line to make all replacements at once. Delete the file prefill.php as well.

This is where your description should go. Try and limit it to a paragraph or two, and maybe throw in a mention of what
PSRs you support to avoid any confusion with users and contributors.
